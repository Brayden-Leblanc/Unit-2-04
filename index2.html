     <h2 style="font-size:30px;">What is the Greenhouse Effect?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;font-family:verdana;">The greenhouse effect is the climate changing as a result of an alteration of the natural greenhouse. The burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil increase the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. By increasing these abundance of greenhouse gases (like CO2) in the atmosphere we directly amplify the Earth’s natural greenhouse effect resulting in various changes being made to climate. This concept is applied in this photo as cars are one of the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect as they burn fossil fuels releasing CO2. This affects life and society as climate change can cause higher temperatures resulting in more heat death and illness, raging forest fires, increased electric cooling demand, an impact on water supply, a threat to ecosystems as their habitat changes, droughts, melting permafrost, disease, less sea ice, and many more.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Why is this important?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:150%;font-family:courier;">It is useful to understand the science behind this so that we can prevent it from happening as much as we as individuals possibly can. In this instance, using a car less would result in a positive impact on the climate, and climate change.</p>

      “Climate change is real. 
      It is happening right now, 
      it is the most urgent threat 
      facing our entire species and
      we need to work collectively 
      together and stop procrastinating.”

      -Leonardo Di Caprio, Actor and Environmentalist
